    "- many applications in todays web rely heavily on I/O operations like downloading contents of a web page from internet, running several queries together against a database like PostGres.  A web request or communication with a micro service can take hundreds of milliseconds or seconds if network is slow.  a database query can be time intensive if database is under a high load or query is complex.  A web server may need to handle hundreds or thousands of requests at the same time.  \n",
    "- making many of these i/o requests at once can be time consuming and lead to substantial performance bottlenecks.  example. if we write an applicatoin to download 100 pages or run 100 queries each of which takes one second to execute, application will take atleast 100 seconds to run.  \n",
    "- If we use concurrency and start downloads and wait simultaneously, we could complete all of this in under one second\n",
    "- asyncio was introduced as way to handle these concurrent requests outside of multi processing and multi threading.  Properly using this library can lead to drastic performance and resource utilization improvements for applications that are I/O bound as it allows us to start many of these long running tasks together.  \n",
